# Python to Artificial Intelligence

On this Github, I cover everything from Python to Artificial Intelligence with different Python, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning programs.

Theoretical concepts are covered on the [Github Wiki](https://github.com/ikathuria/python-to-ai/wiki) with practical codes available on in the repository. For detailed explanations, videos are available on my [YouTube channel](). For more tutorials, check out my articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@ishani-kathuria).
